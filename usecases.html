<h2>Creating Soundscapes for Games</h2>
<p>
April works for a computer game company and is responsible for creating soundscapes for
games. Moving the game to use libkunquat for sound rendering lets April use graphical
tools from Kunquat project to tie songs and sounds into the game world and have game
elements respond to changes in the music as well. In this use case libkunquat would also
take care of sound effects played when the character jumps or collects a coin.

<h2>Digital Music Production</h2>
<p>
May creates and sells albums of digital music online. She is musical, but does not have a
training for playing an instrument. Kunquat-tracker lets her create her music albums by
editing as an alternative for having to play the instruments in real time. She
occasionally records a small set of notes through MIDI interface or using the qwerty
keyboard when she is on the run.

<h2>Live Performances</h2>
<p>
June plays keyboard in a band in front of a live audience. She has traditionally used
hardware synthesizers to produce sound, but is looking for software alternatives to make
her gear more portable. She decides to use Kunquat instruments for rendering her keyboard
playing into sound on stage.
