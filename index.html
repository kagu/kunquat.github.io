<p>Kunquat is a music sequencer similar to tracker programs. Some of its distinctive features include high time resolution and flexible tuning configuration. Great care is also taken in designing a mixing infrastructure to allow mixing logical bodies instead of hardware forced channels.</p>
<p>The design is partially motivated by the desire to compose interactive music, that reacts on changes in the environment where the music is played. Such factors might include the events in a video game, or the amount of customers in a restaurant where the music is played.</p>

<h2>Releases</h2>
<h3>Kunquat 0.6.1</h3>
<p>2014-03-18</p>
<p>
There has been silence for some time now when it comes to Kunquat releases. However, the development side has been active during this non-break. We have moved development to GitHub and upgraded our development process to match that.
</p>

<p>
Since the previous release we have rewritten the tracker several times to experiment with different threading and programming models. While we have now found a model that seems to work, the tracker has lost lots of features that need rewriting to match the new model. We will be returning old features back one by one in future releases.
</p>

<p>
While many old features were lost in the architecture upgrade, the tracker also gained some new features. The new release introduces an on-screen keyboard that visualizes played notes with intense twinkle. Keyboard jamming is now a recognized use case and the latency and performance of the tracker have been adjusted accordingly. The tracker includes a log window that show what Kunquat events are fired in the background. In addition, some performance measurements are displayed in the about window.
</p>

<p>
In addition to improvements in the tracker, we have also improved the API and architecture of the Kunquat C library. It is now possible to get an estimate of the duration of a Kunquat song without breaking the playback state. It is also possible to retrieve all fired events regardless of how many events are fired at once. We also added instrument controls that allow the user to rearrange their instruments more efficiently. Finally, we rewrote the sequencer code to give us more flexibility when implementing new features in the playback code.
